_____WRITING A SCRIPT_____
BASH scripts can be written in Terminal text editors, such as nano

ls junk
nano
# goes into the junk directory then text editor

cd
mkdir bin
# best practice is creating a directory in the home directory called 'bin'

~ = alt + n

_____EXAMPLE SCRIPT_____

#!/bin/bash

# this is a simple script

echo "hello"

exit
________________________

# that's a BASH script above
# script is named as 'hello' and saved (can't be named with a space)

ls
> hello

chmod +x hello
# makes it an executable file

ls
> hello
# 'hello' is now in green, showing it is an executable

./hello
# script runs
# if this script was in a bin folder, you could run it just by name 

which hello
# shows location of script

mv hello ~/bin/

_____EXAMPLE SCRIPT 2_____

#!/bin/bash

# system check

echo "Uptime is:"
